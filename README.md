# fullstack-react-v2.0
 Second version of my REACT Project but this time using JSX.
In order to run you need to open a terminal for the client folder, and one for the server folder. Then do NPM I on both each one seperatly. Then to run, use NPM START on the client side, and NODEMON APP or NODE APP on the server side.
